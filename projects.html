<h1>h.h. veldstra - resumé, past projects &amp;c</h1>

<div id="resume">
<h2>background</h2>

<p>I am a generalist software developer with a product design background, and a proven ability to dive deep and solve challenging technical problems when needed.</p>

<p>I have worked on consumer webapps, RESTful APIs, compilers, web scrapers,
applied machine learning, video transcoding and delivery, and dataviz projects
using a variety of languages, frameworks and platforms.</p>

<p>I am interested in early-stage projects where I can wear multiple hats
and where I can assume responsibility for an important part of the product.
I am especially interested in <nobr>user-facing</nobr> work but I do enjoy working
on backend services too.</p>


<h2>tools</h2>

<p>Python, Erlang, Javascript; Django, Flask; nginx; frontend dev with HTML5, CSS3, jQuery; D3; Redis, Postgres; Linux (Ubuntu) administration; AWS (EC2, S3, Route53); Heroku; probably some others I forget.</p>


<h2>big projects</h2>

<h3><a href="http://vidiowiki.com">Vidiowiki</a></h3> <span class="date">(2009-2012)</span>
<p>Lead developer for a video-based exploratory search engine with 100% original content and a mindmap-based search interface.</p>

<p>I worked on video uploading, transcoding and delivery (Python, ffmpeg, mencoder); a tool to allow users to create videos right on the site, including recording video with their webcams (Flex, JS); the user-facing Django-based web UI; and the visualization of relationships between videos (both UI and recommendations).</p>

<p>Vidiowiki raised a small seed round, and reached break-even point within 18 months of launch.</p>

<h3><a href="http://vixo.com">Hypernumbers</a> (now <a href="http://vixo.com">Vixo</a>)</h3> <span class="date">(2007-2009)</span>

<p>Part of a team of three that developed  a fully-functional
online spreadsheet in Erlang in a year, with Excel file import, support for all of Excel's
built-in functions, and features unique to Hypernumbers such as the ability to keep any
cells in sync between any spreadsheets, full audit history, form creation, and collaboration features. (<a href="http://vixo.com/explore/features/">full list of Vixo's features</a>)</p>

<p>I built the the formula engine (100% Excel compatibility, multilingual - en, de, fr, es, jp, ru, pt), a framework to
automate testing of compatibility with Excel (tens of thousands of tests), and was responsible for i18n throughout the product.</p>

<p>Hypernumbers was one the winners of Seedcamp 2007.</p>
