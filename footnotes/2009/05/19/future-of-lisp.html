<p>&#8230;is <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, <a href="http://github.com/rvirding/lfe/tree"><span class="caps">LFE</span></a> etc, i.e. implementations of Lisp running on top of popular virtual machines. There are two advantages to this approach:</p>
<ol>
	<li>You get a lot of libraries for free, as long as the author spent a bit of time thinking about interop.</li>
	<li>(new) Lisp code can live side-by-side with (older) Java, Erlang &amp;c code. There is no need for a radical rewrite or any interop difficulties &#8212; you simply write parts of your system in Lisp where it makes sense, perhaps gradually replacing older non-Lisp code.</li>
</ol>
<p>This would also mean that:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common Lisp</a> is not going to get mainstream for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>It&#8217;s full of what looks like cruft to beginners.</li>
	<li>It&#8217;s not straightforward to get started with. Advising newbies to learn Emacs &amp; <span class="caps">SLIME</span> is not wise and doesn&#8217;t work. Choosing an implementation to start with can be tricky too.</li>
	<li>The community is not making an effort to make CL seem cool.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/"><span class="caps">PLT</span> Scheme</a> is not a contender either, because it&#8217;s perceived as little more than a Lisp for teaching, which isn&#8217;t true, but the community isn&#8217;t doing much to shatter this perception.</p>
