I presented at [ScotlandJS](http://scotlandjs.com) last Friday on [Heyso](http://heyso.im)'s Node.js/Sockjs/Redis-based backend and load-testing properly (i.e. not by `curl`ing the same URL in a loop or sending the same WebSocket message over and over)

I am not publishing the slides since they won't make much sense on their own, but I'm hoping to publish a series of blog posts on topics covered in my talk, SOON.

Thank god for Red Bull - it just wouldn't've happened without it.
